## Make Change Project

### Description

A simple program to take a cost and amount paid and return exact change, prioritizing larger denomination bills over smaller.

### Topics and Technologies Used

* while loops
* if statements
* fixing inaccuracies caused by doubles interacting
* taking and using user input
* methods with multiple parameters
* printf statements

### How to Run

Run the application
Enter the cost of your item, then enter the amount you're going to pay.
You will receive correct change.

### Lessons Learned
* breaking code into chunks
* doubles lose accuracy and must be closely watched when used
* using while loops to prevent users from continuing until proper values have been entered
* formatting with printf
